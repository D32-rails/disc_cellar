# Disc Cellar

You have a wine cellar, right? (At least in our dreams.) You keep track of all the wine you've got in your cellar, so you know at all times what you have.

But we're guessing you have no idea all the DVDs you've got. We've all been in a store and wondered, "Do I already have this DVD?" And we're guessing at least 95% of the time you do, even though you forgot. (Figures not necessarily accurate.)

That's where Disc Cellar comes in.

Easily keep track of what DVDs you currently own. Remember who you loaned one to, so you can nag them to give it back.
